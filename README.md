- [X] Vue Cli 3 - [instructions](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html)

## Development Server

Run Flask Api development server:

```
$ python run.py
```

From another tab in the same directory, start the webpack dev server:

```
$ yarn serve
```

The application will be served from `localhost:8080` and the Flask Api
and static files will be served from `localhost:5000`.

Proxy config in `vue.config.js` is used to route the requests
back to Flask's Api on port 5000.

If you would rather run a single dev server, you can run Flask's
development server only on `:5000`, but you have to build build the Vue app first
and the page will not reload on changes.

```
$ yarn build
$ python run.py
```
